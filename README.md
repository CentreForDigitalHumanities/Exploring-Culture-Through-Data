# Exploring Culture Through Data (Data School Summer School)
Welcome to the [Exploring Culture Through Data: Digital Methods & Data Practices](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/humanities/exploring-culture-through-data-digital-methods-data-practices) Summer School! We are excited to offer an in-depth exploration of using digital methods and data practices to analyze and understand culture. Join us to learn how to leverage data to gain insights into various cultural phenomena. Whether you are new to programming or an experienced data analyst, we have something for everyone.
