# Syllabus

This course is designed to provide you with the tools and concepts needed to work with data in the context of digital humanities research. It consists of lectures, tutorials, demonstrations, exercises, and a group assignment. Below you find a description of the topics that will be covered each day.

## Preparation 
The preparation materials covered the basics of Python programming. Hopefully you have successfully installed Anaconda on your machine, and completed the exercises. The preparation exercises showed you how to execute code, work with the most common data types, and how to use variables, containers, and loops. On Tuesday, we will review the materials and answer any questions you may have. 

## Day 1: Data in concept
On the first day, we will have time to get to know each other and our backgrounds, as well as the outline and goals of this summer school. The concept of data is central to this day, and we will see how different backgrounds may influence the way we look at data. We will also provide examples of our own research and how we have used digital methods in our work. The day will end with a brainstorming session on the group assignment in which you will apply the skills you have learned throughout the week. 


## Day 2: Python
The second day focuses on programming in Python. There will be two blocks that focus on programming, and one guest lecture on Data Journalism. 

The first programming block will start with a recap of the preparation materials, in which we walk through the notebooks and answer any questions you may have. It is important that you understand the basics of Python programming before we move on to the next steps. In a demonstration, we will inform you about some essential terminology and syntax. 

The second programming block will introduce you to Pandas, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. We will show you how to read and explore your data in Python, and how to perform basic manipulations. You apply your new skills in a hands-on exercise.  

## Day 3: Data collection
Wednesday is data collection day. We will start with an introduction to the tools and resources available for collecting data. 



## Day 4: Data analysis & visualization
- Basic stats 
    - Counts of column values 
    - Visualization 
- Word clouds 
    - Tokenization 
    - Stop word filtering 
    - Visualization
- Word representation
