# Syllabus

This course is designed to provide you with the tools and concepts needed to work with data in the context of digital humanities research. It consists of lectures, tutorials, demonstrations, exercises, and a group assignment. Below you find a description of the topics that will be covered each day.

## Preparation 
The preparation materials covered the basics of Python programming. Hopefully you have successfully installed Anaconda on your machine, and completed the exercises. The preparation exercises showed you how to execute code, work with the most common data types, and how to use variables, containers, and loops. On Tuesday, we will review the materials and answer any questions you may have. 

## Day 1: Data in concept
On the first day, we will have time to get to know each other and our backgrounds, as well as the outline and goals of this summer school. Data School researcher Dennis Nguyen will give a lecture on Thinking in Data. We will also provide examples of our own research and how we have used digital methods in our work. The day will end with a brainstorming session on the group assignment in which you will apply the skills you have learned throughout the week. 

## Day 2: Python
The second day focuses on programming in Python. There will be two blocks that focus on programming, with a guest lecture on Data Journalism by digital creator Hay Kranen in between.

The first programming block will start with a recap of the preparation materials, in which we walk through the notebooks and answer any questions you may have. It is important that you understand the basics of Python programming before we move on to the next steps. In a demonstration, we will inform you about some essential terminology and syntax, as well as strategies for troubleshooting.  

The second programming block will introduce you to Pandas, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. We will show you how to read and explore your data in Python, and how to perform basic manipulations. You apply your new skills in a hands-on exercise.  

Optionally, you can join us for drinks at the end of the day. The drinks will take place at Café de Bastaard, a cozy café in the city center of Utrecht. 

## Day 3: Data collection
Wednesday is data collection day. The morning session will focus on the concept of data, and we will see how different backgrounds and perspectives may influence the way we look at data. We will also introduce you to some tools and resources available for collecting data.

The afternoon starts with a lecture on the ethics around data collection and use by Data School researcher Julia Straatman. Here you will learn to be critical about the data you collect, and how to handle it responsibly. The lecture is followed by a hands-on session on webscraping. We will show you how to collect data from websites, and how to store it in a structured format. If there is time left, you can start collecting data for your group assignment.

## Day 4: Data analysis & visualization
Thursday is all about text analysis methods and data visualization. We will start with a lecture on text analysis, followed by a notebook that introduces you to the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We will interactively show you how to work with tokenization, stop word filtering, finding word frequencies, and more. 

In the afternoon, we will focus on data visualization. We will show you how to create visualizations in Python, and how to use them to learn more about your data. You will learn how to create different types of visualizations, and how to customize them to your needs. The day will end with time to work on your group assignment. 

## Day 5: Group assignment
On the final day, there is lots of time to work on your group assignment. We will be available to answer any questions you may have, and to help you with the problems you may encounter. In the afternoon, you will present your results to the group. The day ends with a reflection on the week, and a discussion on how you can apply your new skills in your own research.
