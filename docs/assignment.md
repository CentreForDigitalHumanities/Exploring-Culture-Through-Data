# Group assignment 

This document describes the assignment for the group project. It will be carried out in groups of 3 to 4, ideally with varying backgrounds and levels of programming experience. 

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to apply the concepts and tools learned in this summer school to a topic of your choice. You will work together to collect, analyze, and visualize data, and present your results to the group. 

## Instructions
1. **Choose a topic**: The first step is to choose a topic that interests you. This can be anything, as long as it is feasible to collect data on it. See the section below for some ideas. 

This step also involves defining a research question that you want to answer with your data. The question may change and evolve as you work on the project, but try to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve from the beginning. 

2. **Collect data**: Once you have chosen a topic, you will need to collect data. This can be done by scraping websites, using APIs, or by using existing datasets. 

3. **Analyze data with Python**: After collecting the data, you will analyze it using the tools you have learned in this summer school. This can include cleaning the data, performing text analysis, and visualizing the results. 

4. **Present results**: Finally, you will present your results to the group in the form of slides. The presentation should at least include a brief introduction to the topic, the research question, the data collection process, the analysis, and the results. You can also talk about any challenges you faced during the project and what you learned from them. The presentation should be roughly 10 minutes long, and there is 10 more minutes for a Q&A. 

## Deliverables
There are two deliverables: 
- A Jupyter notebook with the Python code used to collect and analyze the data. Make sure to include comments and explanations in the notebook. 
- A set of slides for the presentation. You can use any tool you like to create the slides, but make sure they are clear and easy to read.
