## Welcome!  
Welcome to the [Exploring Culture Through Data: Digital Methods & Data Practices](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/humanities/exploring-culture-through-data-digital-methods-data-practices) Summer School 2024! We are excited to offer an introduction into digital methods and data practices to analyze and understand culture. In this folder, you find all the materials that will prepare you for the Summer School. 

There are two main parts to the preparation materials:
- Installation instructions. You can find them below. We recommend using [Anaconda Navigator](#anaconda-navigator) and [Jupyter Lab](#jupyter-lab) for the Summer School. If you have another preferred programming environment, you are welcome to use that as well, but we can not ensure that we will have the space and time to assist you with technical issues specific to your environment. 

- Python Programming exercises. We have prepared a series of programming exercises to help you get familiar with Python and Jupyter Lab. We recommend that you complete these exercises before the Summer School starts. Depending on your experience with coding, they might take you 1 to 4 hours to complete. 

We advise you to start well in advance so that you have enough time to complete the exercises, let them sink in, and ask us any questions or issues you might have. 


## Installation instructions 
Before we start the Summer School, we kindly ask you to carry out the following installation instructions to ensure that you have all the necessary software installed on your computer. This will ensure a smooth start of the Summer School. 

If you run into any problems during the installation, please try to resolve them by yourself first. The internet is full of useful information, and finding solutions to technical problems is a valuable skill for a (soon-to-be) programmer. Of course we are happy to help you if you really get stuck, don't hesitate to send us an email in that case. 

### Anaconda Navigator
Our programming environment of choice is Anaconda Navigator. It offers a variety of programming interfaces for Python, as well as pre-installed libraries for scientific computing. Please follow the steps below.

1) Download Anaconda Navigator. \
You can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so choose your operating system and click the download button.
2) Install Anaconda Navigator. \
Follow the instructions of the installer. There's no need to change any of the default settings (but you can if you want). Installation can take several minutes. 

Note that the entire program takes up about 9GB of disk space. If this is not an option for you, you can also install Miniconda, which is a more compact version of Anaconda with fewer preinstalled packages. You can download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Just find your operating system in the table and follow the instructions. 

Once Anaconda is installed, you don't need to install the Python programming language separately, as Anaconda comes with its own Python distribution. 


### Jupyter Lab
We will use Jupyter Lab as our programming environment. Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for Python. You can install Jupyter Lab by opening the Anaconda Navigator and clicking on the Jupyter Lab icon. Once Jupyter Lab is installed, you can open it by clicking on the Launch button. 

Let's check if everything is working as intended by following these steps: 
1) Open Anaconda Navigator. \
Locate the program on your computer and open it.

2) Find Jupyter Lab, and click on the Launch button.\
Note that it's possible that you need to install Jupyter Lab first. If that's the case, you can do so by clicking on the Install button. 

When you open Jupyter Lab, you should see panel to the left with a file browser, a central panel with the content of the file you are currently working on, and a right panel with the Anaconda Assistant. You can close the assisstant panel by clicking on the sparkle icon in the top right corner. 

It's good practice to create a new folder for each course you take to keep your files organized. If you have not yet done so, create a new folder for the Summer School and move this folder into it. 

3) In Jupyter Lab, open the file `1a_getting_started.ipynb`. \
You can navigate to the folder where you saved the preparation materials for the Summer School, and open it by double-clicking on it. You should see a list of files, including this file. Open the first file by double-clicking on it. 

If this all works, you are ready to start working on the materials. Have fun coding!
