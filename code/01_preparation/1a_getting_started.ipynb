    "Jupyter Notebooks work with small blocks of code called `cells`. They allow you to run code in small chunks, making it easier to understand and debug. It also allows you to write text in `Markdown` format, which is what you are reading right now. Ideal for educational purposes! \n",

    "- Before running a cell, you can try to predict what the output will look like. \n",
