## Welcome!  
Welcome to the [Exploring Culture Through Data: Digital Methods & Data Practices](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/humanities/exploring-culture-through-data-digital-methods-data-practices) Summer School 2024! We are excited to offer an introduction into digital methods and data practices to analyze and understand culture. In this folder, you find all the materials that will prepare you for the Summer School. 

There are two main parts to the preparation materials:
- Installation instructions. You can find them below. We recommend using Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter Lab for the Summer School. If you have another preferred programming environment, you are welcome to use that as well, but we can not ensure that we will have the space and time to assist you with technical issues specific to your environment. 

- Python Programming exercises. We have prepared a series of programming exercises to help you get familiar with Python and Jupyter Lab. We recommend that you complete these exercises before the Summer School starts. Depending on your experience with coding, they might take you 1 to 4 hours to complete. 

We advise you to start well in advance so that you have enough time to complete the exercises, let them sink in, and ask us any questions or issues you might have. 


## Installation instructions 
Before we start the Summer School, we kindly ask you to carry out the following installation instructions to ensure that you have all the necessary software installed on your computer. This will ensure a smooth start to the Summer School. 

If you run into any problems during the installation, please try to resolve them by yourself first. The internet is full of useful information, and finding solutions to technical problems is a valuable skill for a (soon-to-be) programmer. Of course we are happy to help you if you really get stuck, don't hesitate to send us an email in that case. 

### Anaconda Navigator
Our programming environment of choice is Anaconda Navigator. It offers a variety of programming interfaces for Python, as well as pre-installed libraries for scientific computing. You can download Anaconda from the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so choose your operating system and follow the instructions on the website to install Anaconda on your computer. Once Anaconda is installed, there is no need to install Python separately, as Anaconda comes with its own Python distribution. 

### Jupyter Lab
We will use Jupyter Lab as our programming environment. Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for Python. You can install Jupyter Lab by opening the Anaconda Navigator and clicking on the Jupyter Lab icon. Once Jupyter Lab is installed, you can open it by clicking on the Launch button. Alternatively, you can open Jupyter Lab from your Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) by typing `jupyter-lab`. 

In the first lesson of the preparatory materials, we will explain how to use Jupyter Lab. So make yourself some tea, coffee, or your favorite beverage, and head over to the `preparatory_code` folder to start the first lesson.
